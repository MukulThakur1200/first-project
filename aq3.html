           <p>Teams A and B are having a penalty shoot-out to decide the winner of their football match. Each team gets to take a shot N times, and the team with the higher number of scored goals at the end wins. If the number of goals scored during the shoot-out by each team turns out to be the same even after all 2N shots, then they stop and agree that the result is a draw.
<br>
The two teams take shots alternately — team A shoots first, then team B shoots, then team A and so on until team B takes its N-th shot (at which point each team has taken exactly N shots). Even though all 2N shots are taken, the result of the shoot-out is often known earlier — e.g. if team A has already scored N−1 goals and team B has missed at least two shots, team A is definitely the winner.
<br>
For each shot, you know whether it was a goal or a miss. You need to find the earliest moment when the winner is known — the smallest s (0≤s≤2N) such that after s shots, the result of the shoot-out (whether team A won, team B won or the match is drawn) would be known even if we did not know the results of the remaining 2N−s shots.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.<br>

           <p>Given an array of integers. Find the Inversion Count in the array.

Inversion Count: For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0. If an array is sorted in the reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum. <br>
Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i is less then j .<br>
